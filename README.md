# Groove n' Bloom
“Groove n’ Bloom” is a beat sequencer inspired by my love of gardening created for CS476A Fall 2023 at Stanford University. Over the last quarter, I have slowly been amassing a small army of plants (now close to 20) in my dorm room by my windowsill. The wonder and peace I experienced just by seeing my plants make little progress, day by day, inspired me to keep going myself.
